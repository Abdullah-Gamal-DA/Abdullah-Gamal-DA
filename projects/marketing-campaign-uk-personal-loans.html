          <p><strong>Data Analysis of a Marketing Campaign for Personal Loans in the UK</strong></p>
          <p>Data Analysis of a Marketing Campaign for Personal Loans in the UK<br>
          Aug 2025 - Aug 2025</p>
          <p>I conducted an analysis of a marketing campaign launched by a bank in the United Kingdom targeting personal loans. In 2022, the personal loan market size reached around £1.5 billion, and the dataset contained more than 41,000 records covering the full year.</p>
          <p><strong>My Role:</strong><br>
          Analyzed demographic data (age, education, occupations). Performed statistical testing using Pearson correlation to validate the relationship between call duration and campaign success. Examined the impact of interest rates and inflation (CPI) on campaign outcomes. Developed actionable recommendations to enhance targeting and optimize marketing expenditure.</p>
          <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong><br>
          The most represented age group was between 30 and 45 years old. A moderate but statistically significant correlation was found between call duration and campaign outcome. Campaign performance was strongly influenced by interest rates (higher success when rates were lower). Inflation (CPI) trends were associated with changes in interest rates, which impacted campaign effectiveness.</p>
          <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>
          Expand targeting to include age groups outside 30–45. Improve call scripts and communication methods to increase effectiveness. Concentrate marketing spending during periods of lower interest rates. Monitor inflation expectations (CPI) to anticipate rate changes and plan campaigns accordingly.</p>
